To run the project:
  1) npm run dev.
  2) Click the localhost:3000 on the terminal.

Frontend dependencies:
  1) framer-motion
  2) next-themes
  3) react-icons
  4) lucide-react
  5) dotenv

Constraints:
  1) The Light/dark button is not not functioning fully which I had to exclude it from the portfolio.

Personal opinion on improving self-skills in coding:
  1) I'd like to take further challenge by doing coding faster and accurate by making less errors.
